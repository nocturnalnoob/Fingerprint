Fingerprint Sensor Enrollment for Vehicle Access Control

This Arduino code implements a fingerprint sensor enrollment system for vehicle access control. The system uses the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor library and a SoftwareSerial connection for communication with the fingerprint sensor module.

Key Features:

Enrolls fingerprints for vehicle access control.
Utilizes a SoftwareSerial connection to communicate with the Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor.
Provides feedback during the enrollment process through serial communication.
Designed to be used with Arduino-compatible hardware.
How to Use:

Connect the fingerprint sensor module to the specified RX and TX pins.
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
Open the Arduino Serial Monitor to interact with the enrollment system.
Follow the on-screen instructions to enroll fingerprints for vehicle access.
